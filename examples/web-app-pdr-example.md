- 2 Backend Developers (Node.js/PostgreSQL)
- 1 DevOps Engineer (AWS/Kubernetes)
- 1 UX/UI Designer
- 1 QA Engineer
- 1 Product Manager

**Infrastructure:**
- AWS EKS cluster (3 nodes minimum)

- Various monitoring and analytics tools

**Risk Assessment:**
**High Priority Risks:**
1. **Payment Integration Complexity**
   - Risk: Stripe integration delays due to compliance requirements
   - Mitigation: Start integration early, involve security team from beginning
   - Contingency: Have backup payment provider (PayPal) ready

2. **Performance Under Load**
   - Risk: System performance degradation with high user load
   - Mitigation: Implement comprehensive load testing, use CDN, optimize database queries
   - Contingency: Auto-scaling infrastructure, performance monitoring alerts

3. **Data Security Breach**
   - Risk: Customer data or payment information compromise
   - Mitigation: Follow security best practices, regular security audits, encryption
   - Contingency: Incident response plan, insurance coverage

**Medium Priority Risks:**
1. **Team Availability**
   - Risk: Key team members unavailable due to illness/vacation
   - Mitigation: Knowledge sharing, documentation, cross-training
   - Contingency: Temporary contractor resources

2. **Third-party Service Outages**
   - Risk: Stripe, AWS, or other critical services experiencing downtime
   - Mitigation: Multi-region deployment, service redundancy
   - Contingency: Graceful degradation, status page communication

**Low Priority Risks:**
1. **Scope Creep**
   - Risk: Additional features requested during development
   - Mitigation: Clear requirements, change control process
   - Contingency: Phase future features into later releases
